## What is this?

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jarrodhroberson/Stack-Overflow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jarrodhroberson/Stack-Overflow)

This repository holds all my extensive code answers to questions on Stack Overflow.

I sometimes post a gist if it is an extremely small amount of code I want to remember.

I decided to keep track of all my valuable answers for future reference when I need that same solution!
